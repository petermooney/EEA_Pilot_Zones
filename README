Python script to generate GML zones file from another GML file (shapefile conversion)  

** This is an example of using Python to generate the new IPR compliant XML for zones
from a GML file **

You should have converted your zones shapefile to GML using a GIS or ogr2ogr first. 

The python code assumes that your GML file is called "AIRZONES.gml". 

The example for Ireland is shown. 

Please review the gml.cfg (Python config file) to see the various options. These are mainly focused on 
the attirbute names in the original shapefile.

To run the code - you can do so from the command prompt. 


python createAQD-Zones-configReader.py > name-of-output-file.gml

You can open this GML file in a desktop GIS to check that it was correctly created. 

This code is likely to change frequently as I learn more about (1) the IPR Zones schemata and (2) have time to make the code much more functional. 

In this first version I have purposely stayed away from using 3rd party libraries (open source ones...) to do things like reading directly from Shapefile. The reason for this is that the code will be much easier to run without needing to check on library dependancies.

Installation

No real installation needed. A fully working Python installation is needed on your machine - only core libraries are used by this example.
