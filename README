** This is an example of using Python to generate the new IPR compliant XML for zones
from a GML file **

You should have converted your zones shapefile to GML using a GIS or ogr2ogr first. 

The python code assumes that your GML file is called "AIRZONES.gml". 

The example for Ireland is shown. 

Please review the gml.cfg (Python config file) to see the various options. These are mainly focused on 
the attirbute names in the original shapefile.

To run the code - you can do so from the command prompt. 


python createAQD-Zones-configReader.py > name-of-output-file.gml

You can open this GML file in a desktop GIS to check that it was correctly created.
